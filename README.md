# Weather Api

Sample weather api start to demonstrate data access object (DAO) design pattern, javalin, log back and testing.

Test Driven Development (TDD): Mockito and Junit 5 testing for service layer. Creates mock DAO before implementing the DAO.

## Workflow

1. run app
2. creates weather controller (right now just an array list)
3. start api
4. register methods with endpoints and handler
5. handler returns void type with context object parameter
